# Leveraging AI in Waste Management: Deploying Variants of Convolutional Neural Network in Garbage Classification

## Incentive

During our extensive study at the University of Toronto, we identified significant issues with the design of the garbage bins placed throughout the campus, hindering the accurate classification of waste. Our observations revealed two primary concerns. Firstly, the openings designated for different categories of garbage are ill-suited for effective disposal. For instance, the opening assigned to the "garbage" category is too small to accommodate larger items such as lunch boxes. Secondly, the instructions regarding garbage disposal are unclear, making it challenging to determine the appropriate category for a given piece of waste. Consequently, people often resort to randomly discarding garbage in inappropriate slots, undermining our objective of proper waste classification.

Motivated by these findings, we, a dedicated group of students enrolled in the Master of Management Analytics program at the prestigious Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, have decided to contribute our expertise towards enhancing the garbage collection and classification process within the institution. With our project, we aim to address the shortcomings of the current system and provide practical solutions for improved waste management. By leveraging our skills and knowledge, we intend to make a meaningful impact on campus sustainability and promote responsible waste disposal practices. This initiative aligns with our collective passion for creating a cleaner and more environmentally conscious university environment.

To achieve our goals, we have established a dedicated GitHub repository that serves as a collaborative platform for our project. Through this repository, we will openly share our progress, code, documentation, and any additional resources developed along the way.

## Background on Garbage Classification

Waste management is an essential process that helps in reducing the negative impact of human activities on the environment. The improper disposal of waste can lead to soil, air, and water pollution, which can have devastating consequences for the ecosystem and human health. Waste management involves the collection, transportation, and disposal of waste in a safe and sustainable manner. It plays a crucial role in conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change. According to an analysis done by the World Bank, it estimates that nearly 2 billion tons of waste are generated annually, and the amount of waste generated in North America is expected to double by 2050. The World Bank has allocated $4.7 billion to more than 300 waste management programs globally, while the Canadian government has allocated $500 million to waste management services across Canada.

In recent years, machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been increasingly employed to automate waste classification. These models can accurately identify different types of waste materials based on their visual features, which can significantly improve waste management efficiency and reduce human error. 

## Goal of the Project

As our initial endeavor in our commitment to environmental preservation and the enhancement of the garbage collection and classification process, our project's primary objective is to employ various iterations of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for waste classification. By developing this algorithm, we aim to establish a solid foundation upon which we can subsequently embark on a broader and more comprehensive project, exploring its practical applications and implications.

## Data

Our project utilized two distinct datasets, serving as the _primary_ and _supplementary_ sources of data, respectively. The primary dataset, known as _TrashNet_ or _Garbage Classification Data_, was acquired from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification}{Kaggle}. It consists of approximately 2500 images that were employed for training our models. We selected this dataset based on its widespread usage in prior studies on garbage classification. Consequently, it serves as a benchmark against which we can evaluate our results.

To assess the robustness of our trained model's predictions, we further employed a supplementary dataset obtained also from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification}{Kaggle}. This additional dataset was utilized to conduct rigorous testing and validation of our model's performance. For comprehensive details regarding the datasets, including specific information and insights, please refer to the report provided within this repository.
